    "\n",
    "### Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented application, a journaling tool, offers the following features:\n",
    "*   **Journal Entry Recording:** Users can submit text entries, which are timestamped and stored.\n",
    "*   **Mood Classification:** Entries are automatically classified into 'high energy', 'low energy', or 'neutral' moods using simple keyword matching. This classification is observational and not a medical diagnosis.\n",
    "*   **Non-Leading Follow-Up Questions:** Based on the classified mood, the application generates open-ended questions designed to encourage further reflection on activities, sleep, or general well-being, avoiding diagnostic language.\n",
    "*   **Mood Trend Analysis:** The application can review entries over specified periods to identify patterns of consistent moods (e.g., periods of consecutive 'high energy' or 'low energy' entries).\n",
    "*   **Therapist Report Generation:** A comprehensive, text-based report can be generated, summarizing mood distributions, consistent patterns, and recent entries for a therapist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Usage Example:**\n",
    "A user would input a journal entry, such as \"Today was a fantastic day! I felt so productive and happy.\" The application would then:\n",
    "1.  Classify the mood as 'high energy'.\n",
    "2.  Suggest a follow-up question like \"What activities did you enjoy today?\".\n",
    "3.  Store this entry with a timestamp.\n",
    "Over time, the user can then generate mood trend analyses or a therapist report to review their patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:**\n",
    "It is crucial to reiterate that this application **does not provide diagnoses, medication advice, or emergency services**. All mood classifications and analyses are heuristic and observational, and should not be interpreted as professional psychological assessments or medical advice.\n",

    "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Journal Data Structure:** An empty Python list, `journal_entries`, was initialized to store journal entries, with each entry being a dictionary containing `timestamp`, `text`, `mood`, and `follow_up_question` fields.\n",
    "*   **Basic Mood Classification:** The `classify_mood` function successfully categorizes text into 'high energy', 'low energy', or 'neutral' based on keyword matching. It correctly handled cases such as \"'I am happy and sad.'\", classifying it as 'neutral' due to keyword count ties.\n",
    "*   **Safe Follow-Up Questions:** A function was developed to generate non-leading, open-ended follow-up questions tailored to the classified mood, focusing on general well-being rather than diagnostic symptoms.\n",
    "*   **Journal Entry Recording and Display:** The `add_journal_entry` function effectively integrates mood classification and follow-up question generation, storing complete entries with timestamps and displaying their details.\n",
    "*   **Mood Trend Analysis:** The `analyze_mood_trends` function accurately calculates mood distribution (counts and percentages) and identifies consistent mood patterns, defined as two or more consecutive entries of the same mood, across specified time periods. For instance, in one test, it identified \"A period of 2 consecutive 'high energy' entries ending on 2026-01-23 14:00:00.\"\n",
    "*   **Therapist Report Generation:** A `generate_therapist_report` function was implemented to compile a detailed, observational summary for therapists. This report includes a clear disclaimer, mood distribution (e.g., \"High Energy: 2 entries (25.00%)\", \"Low Energy: 2 entries (25.00%)\", \"Neutral: 4 entries (50.00%)\" in a test scenario), consistent patterns, and recent entries, explicitly avoiding diagnostic language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The current mood classification relies on simple keyword matching, which can be limited. Integrating more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis libraries, machine learning models) could provide more nuanced and accurate mood classifications.\n",
    "*   To enhance the 'consistent mood patterns' analysis, the system could be refined to group entries by day to accurately identify \"three or more consecutive days\" of a particular mood, as hinted in the task, instead of just consecutive entries, which might occur on the same day.\n"
